# 🛒 BestBuy 2.0

A simple, object-oriented store simulation written in Python. This project was created as a learning exercise to deepen my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

## 📚 What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced and strengthened my knowledge in:

- **Classes and Objects**: Modeling real-world entities in code.
- **Inheritance**: Building reusable and extendable class hierarchies.
- **Polymorphism**: Using shared interfaces with different implementations.
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal data and exposing functionality.
- **Modular Design**: Organizing code into separate, manageable files.
- **Testing**: Writing basic unit tests to verify logic and functionality.

## 🧱 Project Structure

```

│
├── main.py              # Entry point of the application
├── console.py           # Console interface logic
├── products.py          # Product classes and logic
├── promotions.py        # Different discount strategies
├── store.py             # Store class that manages inventory and sales
├── test_poduct.py       # Basic unit tests for product functionality
└── .gitignore           # Git ignore file
```

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have **Python 3** installed. Then run the app with:

```bash
python main.py
```

You’ll be able to interact with the store using the terminal: view products, apply promotions, and make purchases.

## ✅ Features

- Different product types and discount strategies
- Inventory tracking and quantity updates
- A CLI interface to simulate customer interaction
- Object-oriented code design and structure

## 🧪 Tests

There’s a small test file for basic product behavior. Run it with:

```bash
python test_poduct.py
```

(More tests could be added for full coverage.)

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

- Add a graphical interface or web frontend
- Store product data persistently (e.g., using JSON or a database)
- Expand the promotions system with more rules
- Improve testing and error handling
- Add support for internationalization (i18n)
